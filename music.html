  This page is actually for my hobbies <wbr /> but since music is my favorite subject among <wbr /> all my hobbies, allow me to start with it. <br /><br />
  Okay so there isn't much more to say, but<wbr /> whoever is reading this must know that <wbr />im a big <mark>FAN</mark> of music. <br>
  <br>
  Personally, my favorite genre is anything <wbr /> to do with <mark>EDM</mark> style songs. I <wbr /> recently started also enjoying new <wbr /> genres like <mark>Amapiano</mark> and <mark>UK Drill</mark><br><br>
  I also make music, using a specialized <wbr /> application called <mark>a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW in short)</mark> <wbr />like FL Studio, Albeton Live and many others.<br><br>

<br /><br />
One of the biggest reasons why I enjoy EDM is <wbr />probably because i used to play games and those <wbr />game developers used to put such interesting<wbr /> tunes as the background music and <wbr />honestly it really <mark>kept us lively</mark> as the players and <wbr />made us to keep coming back to the games.<br><br>

When it comes to sports, first of all<font class="boz"> I don't really<wbr /> enjoy soccer as much as my peers.</font> Maybe the <wbr />hostility shown by fans when teams score goals isn't <wbr />my type of thingðŸ˜‚.. <br><br>
By the time some of these guys even end up<wbr /> fighting from mere arguments over<mark> "who did what<wbr /> better"</mark> , I as a person who dislikes fighting, I <wbr />don't enjoy  such company (doesn't mean I don't know <wbr />how to beat).<br>
But who knows the actual reason why I don't <wbr />enjoy a lot of soccer! It may even just be <wbr /> because my peers used to<mark> dodge me a lot</mark> when I was <wbr />youngerðŸ˜…; and the trauma caught up :) <br><br>
